# TextSummmarizer
# This respository contains two python programs. One is to summarize any amount of text you place into a string. The other is a youtube transcript summarizer. (However, it is currently not working due to various changes on Youtube and restrictions, preventing accessing of captions and therefore the summarization isn't available.)
